Introduction
============

This is the camel-jms quickstart, with a script that will replicate the application for deployment testing.

Note that there are CLI scripts (with instructions) for adding and removing queues that are needed.  Run this before any applications are deployed.

There is a run script that will produce a number of near-copies of the application, each with a unique name, in the 'Apps' directory.
