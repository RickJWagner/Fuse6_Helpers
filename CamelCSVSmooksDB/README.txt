This example demonstrates a framework for running Smooks from within Camel-on-EAP.

This sample reads a CSV file and persists it to a database.  You will need to make alterations to standalone.xml (for the datasource and driver) and will need the MySQL jdbc driver installed as a module in EAP.

A sample data file:
0;aaaaa
1;bbbbb
2;ccccc
