This is an example of a SwitchYard service that offers a WSDL interface.

It uses a Java transformer to map between the incoming and outgoing types.  

The WSDL was edited by hand to add the 'book' element and to make the return type of list 'book'.  
The original WSDL was generated from the Java interface but lacked the above.
